# NodeSaas

![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)

Inspired By [alecrocute's](https://github.com/alectrocute)[flaskSaas](https://github.com/alectrocute/flaskSaaS). I've noticed SaaS bootstraps/boilerplates being sold upwards of $1,000 per year and I think that's fucking ridiculous. This project will be my attempt to make a great starting point for your next big business as easy and efficent as possible.
